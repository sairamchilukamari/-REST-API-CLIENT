A **REST API Client** is a software application that communicates with a RESTful web service to request and consume data over the HTTP protocol. REST (Representational State Transfer) is one of the most widely used architectural styles for designing scalable web services. In this project, a REST API client built using **Java** demonstrates how to connect to APIs, retrieve or send data, parse responses, and integrate services into Java-based applications.

Developing a REST API Client in Java provides valuable insights into how modern software systems interact over the internet, and it plays a crucial role in integrating external services such as weather data, currency exchange rates, social media feeds, or custom backend systems.

### **Technologies Used**

1. **Java SE (Standard Edition)**:

   * The core language used to develop the application.
   * Provides fundamental classes for handling HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and multithreading.

2. **HTTP Libraries**:

   * **HttpURLConnection** (Built-in): Javaâ€™s basic library for making HTTP requests.
   * **Apache HttpClient** (Advanced): A widely-used library for handling HTTP calls with better control over headers, cookies, and connection pools.
   * **OkHttp**: A modern HTTP client for Java with support for asynchronous calls and efficient connection reuse.

3. **JSON Parsing Libraries**:

   * **Jackson** or **Gson**: These libraries are used to convert JSON responses from the API into Java objects (deserialization), and vice versa (serialization).

4. **IDE**:

   * **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or **NetBeans** for development, debugging, and project management.

5. **Build Tools (Optional)**:

   * **Maven** or **Gradle**: Used for dependency management and project configuration.

6. **API Testing Tools (Optional)**:

   * Tools like **Postman** or **cURL** can be used to test APIs before integrating them into the Java client.

### **Project Workflow**

1. **API Selection**:

   * Identify and choose a RESTful API to consume. Examples include OpenWeatherMap (weather data), GitHub API (user repositories), or a custom in-house REST service.

2. **Establishing Connection**:

   * The client sends HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the selected REST API using libraries like HttpURLConnection or Apache HttpClient.

3. **Request Configuration**:

   * Set HTTP method, headers (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Authorization`), and query parameters as required by the API.

4. **Handling Responses**:

   * Responses from the server are typically in **JSON** format.
   * The client reads the response stream and uses a library like Gson or Jackson to parse JSON into Java objects (POJOs).

5. **Displaying or Processing Data**:

   * Once data is received and parsed, it can be displayed in a GUI, printed in the console, or used in further logic such as filtering or storing in a database.

6. **Error Handling**:

   * The client includes mechanisms to handle common issues such as timeouts, incorrect endpoints, HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500), and malformed responses.

### **Features of the Application**

* **Connection to External Services**: Enables integration with third-party or internal REST APIs.
* **Customizable Requests**: Headers, parameters, and body content can be configured dynamically.
* **Efficient JSON Handling**: Uses modern parsing libraries to transform JSON into usable Java objects.
* **Asynchronous Support** (with OkHttp or Executors): Allows making non-blocking API calls.
* **Modular Design**: Components such as API handler, response parser, and UI are separated for scalability and maintenance.

### **Use Cases and Applications**

* **Weather Application**: Connects to a weather API to show forecasts.
* **Finance App**: Consumes currency exchange rates or stock prices.
* **E-commerce Frontend**: Communicates with a backend server to fetch product details, user data, or order information.
* **Educational Tools**: Integrates with APIs to retrieve learning material or student progress.
* **Chatbots**: Interacts with NLP APIs or messaging platforms.
